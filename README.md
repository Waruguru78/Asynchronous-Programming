In this repository, We will see the topics of iterating with async/await, awaiting a call and awaiting concurrent requests.

Instructions
Task 01:
    Iterating with Async/Await: Write an async function iterateWithAsyncAwait that takes an array of values and logs each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.
Task 02:
    Awaiting a Call: Create an async function awaitCall that simulates fetching data from an API. Use await to wait for the API response and then log the data.
Task 04:
    Awaiting Concurrent Requests: Create an async function concurrentRequests that makes two API calls concurrently using Promise.all(). Log the combined results after both requests have resolved.
